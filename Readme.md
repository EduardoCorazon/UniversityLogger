<h1><u>University Automatic Login App</u></h1>
This tools is an Automatic Login script to prevent Shoulder surfing. Unlike just using google chrome's saved passwords, the script will auto input your credentials and due to the sheer speed it's unlikely anyone will even get a glimpse of even your username.
  <h3>Why use it?</h3>
  In an academic environment we are more likely to simply input our credentials while a whole row of students behind us can see our computer screen. While we HOPE no one   will care, if you're security consious then perhaps a script like this is for you.

<h2>❗How to use it: ❗</h2>

1. Simply download the project and unzip it to any desired location.

2. Download the chrome webdriver if you havent already and if on windows save it to "C:\" (File path should be:  C:\chromedriver_win32\chromedriver.exe)

3. To use the script first run <em><b>Config.py</b></em> and follow all the steps.

4. The configuration should be very easy to follow and once it's done there will be an encrypted Config.json file which contains your credentials.
Enjoy!
